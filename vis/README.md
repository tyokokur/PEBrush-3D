Data visualization used for 3D PE brush calculations.

Note: data files themselves are too large (300 MB+) to host anywhere. `sysg3_figures.html` is an export of the Jupyter notebook used to create figures for the manuscript.

Associated helper functions and classes are `Pha3D` for generating isosurfaces and heatmaps, `Process3D` to reformat the isosurfaces, and `Data` to package relevant information. The only function used in `tjy_udf` makes the tick labels in computer modern font. `sysg3_data` contains information on all relevant data runs including free energies and box sizes.
